In this code i applied the parallel program but it keeps going forever. Even for a single file it does
add successfully the lists with the files and the dictionary with the words we are looking for, but it seems
that something keeps the program to run forever. If i change the placement of the locks or change the parallelization
i get a lot of errors.
